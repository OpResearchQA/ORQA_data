You're managing a single-site, producing many products, across different timeframes. Your job is to figure out the best way to produce these products across time to meet customer demand, while not exceeding your production capacity.\nThe goal here is to reduce the overall cost, which is made up of setup costs, production costs, and holding costs. Setup costs are the costs you have when you start making a product, production costs are related to each unit you produce, and holding costs come from storing each unit of inventory for a certain period.\nYour factory has a fixed capacity per timeframe, measured in person-days. You're in charge of two products, each with its own setup time, production time per unit, setup cost, production cost per unit, and holding cost per unit for a certain period. The time it takes to setup and produce each unit affects how much of your factory's capacity is used.\nYou have information about how much of each product is needed in each period. This need has to be met through a combination of production and managing your inventory. Your production plan should meet the need for each product in each period, respect the capacity limits, and above all, keep the total cost down.\nThis task is important at Global Manufacturing Corp. It helps you meet customer needs effectively while keeping a check on production costs and inventory levels.
